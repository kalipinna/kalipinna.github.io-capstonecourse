        <i class="fa fa-steam" aria-label="steam gamepad" id="steam" style="background-image:url('images/neria.jpg')" onclick="show(this)"> videogames</i>
        <p>once I start playing a new game, often rpgs, I'm dead to the world just as much as when I'm creating blogs: Skyrim, Dragon Age, Final Fantasy, Tomb Raider... I prefer long games, possibly with sequels that involve the same characters and the same
          themes, and that aren't too hard to play because somehow growing up I lost most of my gaming skills. I used to be fantastic at shooting games and fighting ones, now I can't even look in Call of Duty's direction!</p>
        <i class="fas fa-dog" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/pug.jpg')" onclick="show(this)" id="dog"> animals</i>
        <p>not going to lie, 95% of my instagram is dedicated to pages about dogs, cats, otters and cute animals because they just make my day better. Need to recharge? Some happy music and a few dogs in costumes and I'm good to go!</p>
        <i class="fas fa-bread-slice" id="bread" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/pizza.jpg')" onclick="show(this)"> food</i>
        <p>if there is one thing that makes me the most stereotypical Italian is my strong relationship with food. You know those jokes about how italian grandmothers will ask you to get the chicken leg from a chicken that has lived in a specific mountain
          and that was then preserved in secret place, in the dark, for no less than six months? I'm that grandmother. I'm that specific about what food I want, I'm going to enjoy every single second of every meal I have, as long as it's composed by dishes
          I like and hate every second of its something I don't like much but choose to eat because healthy. No in between.</p>
        <i class="fa fa-keyboard-o" id="writing" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/posts.jpg')" onclick="show(this)"> writing</i>
        <p>I found myself writing original (admittedly very clich√®-y) stories as a middle-schooler, which evolved into writing fanfiction (aka: I hate what happened to that character, I'm going to write what I think would be a better path for them), which
          turned into collaborative writing on tumblr, having too much fun creating characters that fit in a pre-existing world and coming up with their inner world too, development and reactions to what other people wrote. Sort of like writing tvshows
          except that instead of focusing on one character I ended up making dozens, and a few of them were written for at least six years straight. That also led me to wanting each character to have its own blog with a specific look - and I met HTML
          and CSS for the first time! </p>
        <i class="fab fa-tumblr" id="blogging" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/tumblr.jpg')" onclick="show(this)"> blogging</i>
        <p>I don't only like tumblr because of the opportunities it offers in terms of learning skills - web designers and coders offering tutorials for free out of passion for their jobs, me learning English through writing - but because of the chance it
          gives to connect with people all over the world and learn about different cultures, about communities directly from people who belong in them, and rare obscure things that wouldn't be discussed anywhere else.</p>
        <i class="fas fa-language" id="lang" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/lesson.jpg')" onclick="show(this)"> languages</i>
        <p>I'm Italian, English is a second language and I'm starting to give a first look at Spanish grammar lessons, though there are only so many hours in a day and I gave priority to coding. I admire and want to emulate people who know 5-6 languages,
          because I know how many doors English opened for me. It led me to tumblr, which led me to not only a better understanding of many subjects including psychology, but also to take an interest in web designing, in Photoshop, and in following courses
          that had me noticing other topics such as data analysis and human resources. It also made me write more, reminded me I'm curious about other languages, and so on.</p>
        <i class="fas fa-tv" id="tv" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/buffy.jpg')" onclick="show(this)"> tv</i>
        <p>I was never the sports-kid (shocking, I know), favoring tv instead. It's actually Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its dvds that taught me how to actually communicate in an English that wasn't stiff and directly from schoolbooks, because I loved it
          so much that I just had to listen to it in original language with Italian subs. While I still watch sci-fi and less than happy tvshows, though, in the last couple of years I focused mostly on sitcoms and comedies, as I find them a great way
          to relax in my spare time, with all their silliness and hope. Rewatches of Friends, Will&Grace, Scrubs, Gilmore Girls, Leverage, and other early 2000s shows often accompany my meals. Somehow there is always too much to do to watch a 90min movie,
          but somehow watching 5 episodes of a 20 minutes sitcom in a row works.</p>
        <i class="fas fa-book-reader" id="books" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/lotr.jpg')" onclick="show(this)"> books</i>
        <p>I wasn't just the tv-kid, I was also the kid who forgot to look up from her books unless someone managed to get her attention. I read too fast, though, so I always ended up with nothing new to read: Jurassic Park, the first book that was directly
          gifted to me, lasted about six hours. High school was all about Stephen King and Terry Pratchett, as well as re-reading Lord of the Rings about a million times. Manga, too, no shame in reading light, at time ridiculous stories, though when it
          comes to them for the past few years there was only Gintama.</p>
        <i class="fas fa-table" id="data" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/data.jpg')" onclick="show(this)"> data analysis</i>
        <p>this is a recent development, but having had the opportunity to take the google Data Analytics specialization I found out I love the idea of coming up with ways to solve a problem through research, work on how to gather the data and what data,
          which is something that I had already read about during my university classes but I hadn't seen put in practice (don't ask leading questions, make sure you are not guided by your bias etc.), then actually find ways to gather said data, clean
          it, analyze it, make a presentation... I find it incredibly interesting as well as useful (not only for marketing reasons but for human resources) and while I don't have access to big databases and tools necessary for it, I still plan on learning
          more about it!</p>
        <i class="fas fa-image" id="ps" aria-hidden="true" style="background-image:url('images/28.gif')" onclick="show(this)"> photo editing</i>
        <p>this one was kinda obvious but it had to be mentioned at least once: as you can tell from most of the backgrounds used in this portfolio, I love taking photos, paintings, obviously with the permission of the owner, and editing them to make backgrounds,
          covers, or simply gifs!</p>
        <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap" id="studi" style="background-image:url('images/psych.jpg')" aria-hidden="true" onclick="show(this)"> studies</i>
        <p>I have a 3 years degree in psychological sciences and techniques and took a 2 years specialization in psychology of social and workplace-related processes and of development (although I love clinical too). Still waiting to be able to start my
          internship! <br>Truthfully I carry everything I study with me and end up having long debates with friends even about fictional characters (now, that's just for fun and hypothetical! I know you can't actually analyze them!) and talk about how
          a real person would not react the way they do - which brought me to write a thesis about PTSD out of annoyance towards how lightly it was treated in media (and of course over my extreme interest in the topic).<br>Needless to say I read up far
          too much about every possible topic that hits me, though my favorite sources of learning are always the people who share their struggles and journeys, giving me a completely different point of view on therapy and society expectations that no
          book can offer.</p>
