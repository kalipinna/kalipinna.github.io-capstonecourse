Does the site validate? 10pts
Is the site responsive? 20pts
Is the site well-styled? 10pts
Are the images incorporated effectively? 5pts
Successfully demonstrated the ability to enhance their site?  40pts
Does the site validate? 
10pts – Fully validates (warnings are fine) 
8 pts – There are errors, but the student has shown (in their write-up or video) that they are caused by plugins and can not be fixed. 
6 pts – There are at most 3 errors for the entire site 
3pts – They have only shown that part of the site validates.  (For instance, only tested one of the files in a multi-file site.) 
0 pts – More than three errors  were left or the site was not tested at all.
Is the site responsive?
20pts Yes, the site has a unique look/layout for each of the views.
10pts The site has a unique look, but not a unique layout.  (For example, they changed only colors of fonts, not the actual layout.)
6pts Only some of the pages are responsive - not all of them.
0pts The site is not responsive
 

Is the site well-styled?
This is very objective.  It should be difficult to score a high score, but not difficult to receive the majority of the points.  It is important that everyone create a unique style sheet, even if using a template or framework.  Look for feedback in Week Five to improve your score.

10pts – The site is incredibly well-styled and the author went beyond the required (animation, hovering, etc done with CSS)
8pt – The site is very well styled.   The content has a layout that is easy to follow and a variety of colors and fonts were used. - Most students can expect to receive this score.
4pts – The styling is lacking or the author relied almost exclusively on a template/framework.
0pts – Less than 9 unique CSS rules were used.
 

Enhancements!!
You need to add four elements to your site that are unique – something beyond what we did in the four previous courses.  You are encouraged to be as creative as you would like (and creative does not need to mean time-intensive).  Some options for these "extras" include:

Add custom JavaScript (e.g. incorporate dynamic content, use JS to perform verification, modify the DOM)
Enhance the accessibility of your page (e.g. put your site through the some subset of the WebAim quick evaluation reference - http://webaim.org/resources/evalquickref/)
Incorporate plugins  (e.g. Google Calendar, a map, parallax, etc.)  You will need to show what you did other than just copying code.  Did you need to change any of the attributes?  Change any of the links?
Include a Carousel for your images (don't forget to turn off the automatic start feature if you can!!)
Use a sticky footer to create a consistent look across different browser heights (we usually only consider widths…)
Add a third viewport layout (e.g. a table view that is different than mobile or large-screen) 
Again, these are just suggestions, please feel free to let your own creativity be your guide.

Each extra will be worth 10 pts, for a total of 40 pts.
